        title: 'The Birth of ARPANET',
        content: 'When it was launched, ARPANET was the first wide-area packet-switched network with distributed control and one of the first computer networks to implement the TCP/IP protocol suite. It connected four universities: UCLA, Stanford, UC Santa Barbara, and the University of Utah. The first message sent over the network, "LO" (intended to be "LOGIN"), marks the beginning of people using networked systems to share data.',
